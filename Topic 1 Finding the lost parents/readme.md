## Infrastructures to be used 
* [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/) (GBIF)
* [Catalogue of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/) (CoL)

* [International Plant Names Index](https://www.ipni.org/)

## Rationale
One of the most important drivers of evolution is hybridization. Hybridization and introgression shuffles alleles to create new combinations that are then tested against the environment and can 
lead to novel combinations. The scientific names of hybrids are numerous and can be found in the Catalogue of Life (COL), [International Plant Names Index](https://www.ipni.org/), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Taxonomic Backbone, 
in TreatmentBank and elsewhere, but currently there is no single resource to discover what the parent species of a hybrid are. For example, *Potentilla × pantotricha* Soják is listed in the Catalogue of Life. However, there is no indication within the COL or in other taxonomic resources that it is a hybrid of *P. gorokana* Kalkman and *P. philippinensis* Merr. The only source that reveals the parentage is the original publication (Soják 2003, https://doi.org/10.3372/wi.33.33216).
## Methodology
We propose to parse the parents of hybrids from literature and from taxonomic checklists. Once found these parent names will be linked to the corresponding name within the CoL. We will try to build as long a list of hybrids and names as possible, with the ultimate aim of using these for evolutionary, ecological and taxonomic work. If time permits use these data together with occupancy data from GBIF to calculate the overlap in occupancy between the parents of hybrid taxa.

## Outputs
* A checklist of hybrids and their parent taxa in Darwin Core that is suitable for incorporation into other taxonomic resources.
* Recomendations for matching names to the CoL, IPNI and the GBIF Taxonomic backbone.
* Recomendations for extracting hybrid parents from literature.
